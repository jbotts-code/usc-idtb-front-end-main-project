      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p>My name is John. I’ve worked in product development and market research for the last 5–8 years.</p>
      <p>I’ve led visual design and both <strong>qualitative</strong> and <strong>quantitative</strong> research.
        Earlier in my career I taught math and sports.</p>
      <p>I mainly communicate and network on
        <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/john-botts-772b45244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>Jonathon Botts is a thoughtful designer as I utilize my background in design, sustainability, business
        management, and sociology to achieve a clean system of design making. Circular design has been a major role in
        my career in the creative industry, while also identifying consumerism more effectively to initiate customer
        bases more efficiently.</p>
      <p>My work background focuses on product design within apparel and home decor to achieve product making at a high
        level. Scientific research is applied to analyze waste management concerns and tackle supply chain challenges
        through a sustainable framework. Other research I've developed has been for customer market research to
        strengthen marketing strategies by applying sociological perspectives and methods.</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I carry bachelor's degrees in sustainability, sociology, and a minor in natural resources from Oregon State
        University. The purpose of my education is to better understand the relationship between climate science, human
        behavioral science, and design, because they share a similar foundation. I am also currently pursuing a master's
        degree at the University of Southern California in Integrated Design, Tech, and Business, covering physical
        design, business, and computer engineering.</p>

      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p>This degree focuses on construction that teaches skills to create functional products, and highlights marketing
        and branding tools to prepare me to shape my own entrepreneurial goals and apply machine learning towards web
        and app development for further design communication.</p>
