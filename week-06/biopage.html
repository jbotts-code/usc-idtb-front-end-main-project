    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Jonathon Botts, a passionate designer and developer with a keen interest in creating innovative solutions. With a background in both design and technology, I strive to bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality.</p>
    <p>My journey began with a fascination for how things work, leading me to explore various facets of design and development. Over the years, I've honed my skills in areas such as web development, UI/UX design, and project management.</p>
    <p>When I'm not working on exciting projects, you can find me exploring the outdoors, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or indulging in my love for photography.</p>
    <p>Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just want to connect!</p>
